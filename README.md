# Blackbird

Simple repo for my personal rainmeter setup.
Inspired by the look of the amazing [Enigma](https://github.com/kaelri/enigma) by Kaelri, but all code and resources belong to me.

I wasn't satisfied with a lot of the jerky-looking animated meters out there and wanted something smoother looking so I developed this. The CPU usage is not too high but I probably would not run this on a laptop.

## Requirements

You need to install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) for Windows 10.

## Installation


Clone repo into your Documents\Rainmeter\Skins folder.

Note: for the smooth histograms to work, you need to refresh the skins once after loading because the lua script generates automatic skins that need to be reloaded to function properly. Haven't figured out a way around this yet.
